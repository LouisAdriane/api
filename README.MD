# API NAME

StreamlineAPI

## API
Description

this StreamlineAPI is An API (Application Programming Interface) defines how software components should interact, allowing different applications to communicate and share data. Its purpose is to enable seamless integration between various systems and services. Key features include data access, functionality extension, and standardized communication protocols.

## API
Endpoints

StreamlineAPI offers a range of endpoints for efficient data management. You can create new user profiles with the `/create-user` endpoint, retrieve specific data using `/get-data`, update user information through `/update-user`, delete user profiles with the `/delete-user`, send notifications via `/send-notification`, and generate analytics reports using the `/analytics` endpoint. Each endpoint requires specific parameters, such as user data, filters, and metrics, to perform its designated function effectively.


## Request
Payload

{
  "username": "louis_adriane",
  "email": "louis.adriane@example.com",
  "password": "louis_cordova123",
  "optionalField": "additional_data"
}

"Username," "email," and "password" are obligatory fields necessary for user creation, typically subject to validation for uniqueness and security. "optionalField" is non-compulsory, and its inclusion is not a requirement. It may contain supplementary user information, but user creation can proceed without it.



## Response

Status codes:
When a request is successful, the server returns the requested data with a status code of 200 OK. For instance:
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "User created successfully",
  "data": {
    "user_id": 1,
    "username": "louis_adriane"
  }
}
400 Bad Request: This code is used when the client's request is malformed or has missing parameters. For instance:
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Bad request",
  "error_details": "Missing 'username' field"
}
404 Not Found: This status code indicates that the requested resource was not found. An example might look like:
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Resource not found",
  "error_details": "User with ID 1 not found"
}
500 Internal Server Error: If an unexpected error occurs on the server, it will return a 500 status code. An example could be:
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Internal server error",
  "error_details": "Database connection failed"
}
Response Data:

The response data in JSON format contains the actual content or results of the API request. This can vary depending on the specific API endpoint and the request. For example, if you're fetching user details, the response might look like:
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "user_id": 1,
    "username": "louis_adriane",
    "email": "louis.adriane@example.com",
    "created_at": "2023-10-11T14:30:00Z"
  }
}




## Usage

import requests
import json

# Define the API endpoint URL
url = "https://example.com/api/create-user"

# Define the user data in a Python dictionary
user_data = {
    "username": "louis_adriane",
    "email": "louis.adriane@example.com",
    "password": "louis_cordova123"
}

# Convert the data to JSON format
payload = json.dumps(user_data)

# Define the headers to specify the content type
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Send the POST request to the API
response = requests.post(url, data=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the status code of the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Successful response
    result = response.json()
    print("User created successfully. User ID:", result["data"]["user_id"])
else:
    # Handle error response
    error_data = response.json()
    print("Error:", error_data["message"])
    print("Details:", error_data["error_details"])
